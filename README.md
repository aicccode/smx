National cryptographic algorithms (referred to as "Guomi algorithms") are an independently controllable commercial cryptographic algorithm system approved and recognized by the State Cryptography Administration of China. Currently, they are widely used in key fields such as finance, government affairs, and communications. The released core algorithms include SM2, SM3, SM4, SM9, etc. Among them, SM2 is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm, SM3 is a hash algorithm, SM4 is a symmetric block cipher algorithm, and SM9 is an identity-based cryptographic algorithm. These four types of algorithms are respectively adapted to different security requirements of cryptographic applications.

SM2 算法：全称为 SM2 椭圆曲线公钥密码算法，是我国自主研发的非对称密码算法，其核心基于椭圆曲线点群离散对数难题构建安全体系，相较于传统 RSA 算法具备更高的密码强度 ——256 位的 SM2 算法安全等级已等效于 2048 位 RSA 算法。该算法包含三大核心组件：SM2-1 椭圆曲线数字签名算法（用于数字签名与验签）、SM2-2 椭圆曲线密钥交换协议（用于密钥协商）、SM2-3 椭圆曲线公钥加密算法（用于非对称数据加密），可全面支撑数字签名、密钥协商、数据加密等核心密码功能。

SM2 Algorithm: Fully named SM2 Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptographic Algorithm, it is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm independently developed by China. Its security system is built based on the discrete logarithm problem of elliptic curve point groups, and it has higher cryptographic strength compared with the traditional RSA algorithm —— the security level of the 256-bit SM2 algorithm is equivalent to that of the 2048-bit RSA algorithm. The algorithm consists of three core components: SM2-1 Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (for digital signature and verification), SM2-2 Elliptic Curve Key Exchange Protocol (for key negotiation), and SM2-3 Elliptic Curve Public Key Encryption Algorithm (for asymmetric data encryption), which can fully support core cryptographic functions such as digital signature, key negotiation, and data encryption.

SM3 算法：全称为 SM3 杂凑算法，是我国自主设计的密码哈希算法，适用于商用密码场景下的数字签名与验签、消息认证码生成与验证、安全随机数生成等场景，可满足各类商用密码应用的高安全需求。从哈希值长度维度来看，MD5 算法输出 128 比特哈希值，SHA-1 算法输出 160 比特哈希值，而 SM3 算法输出 256 比特哈希值，更长的输出长度大幅提升了算法的抗碰撞能力，因此 SM3 算法的安全性显著高于 MD5 和 SHA-1 算法。

SM3 Algorithm: Fully named SM3 Hash Algorithm, it is a cryptographic hash algorithm independently designed by China. It is applicable to scenarios such as digital signature and verification, message authentication code generation and verification, and secure random number generation in commercial cryptographic scenarios, and can meet the high security requirements of various commercial cryptographic applications. From the perspective of hash value length, the MD5 algorithm outputs a 128-bit hash value, the SHA-1 algorithm outputs a 160-bit hash value, while the SM3 algorithm outputs a 256-bit hash value. The longer output length greatly improves the anti-collision capability of the algorithm, so the security of the SM3 algorithm is significantly higher than that of the MD5 and SHA-1 algorithms.

SM4 算法：全称为 SM4 分组密码算法，是我国自主设计的对称分组密码算法，主要用于数据的加密与解密运算，保障数据和信息的机密性。对称密码算法的核心安全基础是足够的密钥长度与分组长度，SM4 算法的密钥长度和分组长度均为 128 比特，与国际主流的 AES 算法参数一致，其安全强度远高于 3DES 算法（密钥长度 112/168 比特），是我国商用密码体系中对称加密的核心算法。

SM4 Algorithm: Fully named SM4 Block Cipher Algorithm, it is a symmetric block cipher algorithm independently designed by China, mainly used for data encryption and decryption operations to ensure the confidentiality of data and information. The core security foundation of symmetric cryptographic algorithms is sufficient key length and block length. The SM4 algorithm has a key length and block length of 128 bits, consistent with the parameters of the internationally mainstream AES algorithm, and its security strength is much higher than that of the 3DES algorithm (key length 112/168 bits), making it the core algorithm for symmetric encryption in China's commercial cryptographic system.

SM9 算法：全称为 SM9 标识密码算法，是国家密码管理局发布的基于身份的加密（IBE, Identity-Based Encryption）算法。与传统公钥密码算法不同，SM9 算法直接将用户的身份标识（如手机号、邮箱、身份证号等）作为公钥，无需依赖数字证书完成身份认证与加密解密，大幅简化了密码体系的部署与管理成本，适用于分布式系统、物联网等轻量级密码应用场景。

SM9 Algorithm: Fully named SM9 Identity-Based Cryptographic Algorithm, it is an Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) algorithm issued by the State Cryptography Administration of China. Different from traditional public key cryptographic algorithms, the SM9 algorithm directly uses the user's identity identifier (such as mobile phone number, email, ID card number, etc.) as the public key, and does not need to rely on digital certificates to complete identity authentication, encryption and decryption, which greatly reduces the deployment and management costs of the cryptographic system, and is suitable for lightweight cryptographic application scenarios such as distributed systems and the Internet of Things (IoT).

目前，SM2、SM3、SM4 算法的全部实现均严格遵循国家密码管理局发布的算法规范与测试用例，已通过全维度合规性测试，算法输出结果与官方测试基准完全一致，可直接应用于商用密码产品的研发与部署。

At present, all implementations of the SM2, SM3, and SM4 algorithms in this solution strictly comply with the algorithm specifications and test cases issued by the State Cryptography Administration of China, have passed full-dimensional compliance testing, and the algorithm output results are completely consistent with the official test benchmarks, which can be directly applied to the research and development and deployment of commercial cryptographic products.
